# Configuration Overview

[[toc]]

## PHP Constants

Your `web/index.php` file can define certain [PHP constants](php-constants.md), which Craft’s bootstrap script will check for while loading and configuring Craft.

## General Config Settings

Craft supports several [general config settings](config-settings.md). You can override their default values in your `config/general.php` file.

```php
return [
    'devMode' => true, 
];
```

## Database Connection Settings

Craft supports several [database connection settings](db-settings.md). You can override their default values in your `config/db.php` file.

## Data Caching Config

By default, Craft will store data caches in the `storage/runtime/cache/` folder. You can configure Craft to use an alternative [cache storage](https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/caching-data#supported-cache-storage) by overriding the `cache` application component from `config/app.php`.

```php
<?php
return [
    'components' => [
        'cache' => [
            'class' => yii\caching\ApcCache::class,
            'useApcu' => true,
        ],
    ],
];
```

### Examples

Here are a couple common examples of cache storage configurations:

#### Memcached

```php
<?php
return [
    'components' => [
        'cache' => [
            'class' => yii\caching\MemCache::class,
            'useMemcached' => true,
            'username' => getenv('MEMCACHED_USERNAME'),
            'password' => getenv('MEMCACHED_PASSWORD'),
            'defaultDuration' => 86400,
            'servers' => [
                [
                    'host' => 'localhost',
                    'persistent' => true,
                    'port' => 11211,
                    'retryInterval' => 15,
                    'status' => true,
                    'timeout' => 15,
                    'weight' => 1,
                ],
            ],
        ],
    ],
];
```

#### Redis

To use Redis cache storage, you will first need to install the [yii2-redis](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-redis) library. Then configure Craft’s `cache` component to use it:

```php
<?php
return [
    'components' => [
        'cache' => [
            'class' => yii\redis\Cache::class,
            'defaultDuration' => 86400,
            'redis' => [
                'hostname' => 'localhost',
                'port' => 6379,
                'password' => getenv('REDIS_PASSWORD'),
                'database' => 0,
            ],
        ],
    ],
];
``` 

## Guzzle Config

Craft uses [Guzzle 6](http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/latest/) whenever creating HTTP requests, such as:

- when checking for Craft updates
- when sending in a support request from the Craft Support widget
- when loading RSS feeds from the Feeds widget
- when working with assets on remote volumes, like Amazon S3

You can customize the config settings Guzzle uses when sending these requests by creating a `guzzle.php` file in your `config/` folder. The file should return an array, with your config overrides.

```php
<?php

return [
    'headers' => ['Foo' => 'Bar'],
    'query'   => ['testing' => '123'],
    'auth'    => ['username', 'password'],
    'proxy'   => 'tcp://localhost:80',
];
```

The options defined here will be passed into new `GuzzleHttp\Client` instances. See [Guzzle’s documentation](http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/latest/) for a list of available options.

## Aliases

Some settings and functions in Craft support [Yii aliases](https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/concept-aliases), which are basically placeholders for base file system paths and URLs. These include:

- Sites’ Base URL settings
- Volumes’ Base URL settings
- Local volumes’ File System Path settings
- The <config:resourceBasePath> and <config:resourceBaseUrl> config settings
- The [svg()](../dev/functions.md#svg-svg-sanitize) Twig function

The following aliases are available out of the box:

| Alias | Description
| ----- | -----------
| `@app` | The path to `vendor/craftcms/cms/src/`
| `@config` | The path to your `config/` folder
| `@contentMigrations` | The path to your `migrations/` folder
| `@craft` | The path to `vendor/craftcms/cms/src/`
| `@lib` | The path to `vendor/craftcms/cms/lib/`
| `@root` | The root project path (same as the [CRAFT_BASE_PATH](php-constants.md#craft-base-path) PHP constant)
| `@runtime` | The path to your `storage/runtime/` folder
| `@storage` | The path to your `storage/` folder
| `@templates` | The path to your `templates/` folder
| `@translations` | The path to your `translations/` folder
| `@vendor` | The path to your `vendor/` folder
| `@web` | The URL to the folder that contains the `index.php` file that was loaded for the request
| `@webroot` | The path to the folder that contains the `index.php` file that was loaded for the request

You can define additional custom aliases using the <config:aliases> config setting. For example, you may wish to create aliases that define the base URL and base path that your asset volumes will live in.

```php
'aliases' => [
    '@assetBaseUrl' => 'http://my-project.com/assets',
    '@assetBasePath' => '/path/to/web/assets',
],
```

With those in place, you could begin your asset volumes’ Base URL and File System Path settings with them, e.g. `@assetBaseUrl/user-photos` and `@assetBasePath/user-photos`.

If you’d like, you can set the alias values with environment variables, either from your `.env` file or somewhere in your environment’s configuration:

```bash
ASSETS_BASE_URL=http://my-project.com/assets
ASSETS_BASE_PATH=/path/to/web/assets
```

Then you can pull them into the alias definitions using [getenv()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.getenv.php):

```php
'aliases' => [
    '@assetBaseUrl' => getenv('ASSETS_BASE_URL'),
    '@assetBasePath' => getenv('ASSETS_BASE_PATH'),
],
```

## Overriding Volume Settings

If you would prefer to define volume settings with a config file, you can do that from `config/volumes.php`. The file should return an array whose keys map to your volume handles, and values are nested arrays that define the overridden setting values.

::: warning
You must create your volumes within the Control Panel before Craft will start checking `config/volumes.php` for overrides.
:::

```php
return [
    'siteAssets' => [
        'path' => getenv('ASSETS_BASE_PATH').'/site',
        'url' => getenv('ASSETS_BASE_URL').'/site',
    ],
    'companyLogos' => [
        'path' => getenv('ASSETS_BASE_PATH').'/logos',
        'url' => getenv('ASSETS_BASE_URL').'/logos',
    ],
];
```

## URL Rules

You can define custom [URL rules](https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/runtime-routing#url-rules) in `config/routes.php`. See [Routing](../routing.md) for more details.

## Application Config

You can customize Craft’s entire [application configuration](https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/structure-applications#application-configurations) from `config/app.php`. Any items returned by that array will get merged into the main application configuration array.

### Mailer Component

To override the `mailer` component config (which is responsible for sending emails), do this in `config/app.php`:

```php
<?php

return [
    'components' => [
        'mailer' => function() {
            // Get the stored email settings
            $settings = Craft::$app->systemSettings->getEmailSettings();

            // Override the transport adapter class
            $settings->transportType = craft\mailgun\MailgunAdapter::class;

            // Override the transport adapter settings
            $settings->transportSettings = [
                'domain' => 'foo.com',
                'apiKey' => 'key-xxxxxxxxxx',
            ];

            // Create a Mailer component config with these settings
            $config = craft\helpers\App::mailerConfig($settings);
            
            // Instantiate and return it
            return Craft::createObject($config);
        },

        // ...
    ],

    // ...
];
```

::: tip
Any changes you make to the Mailer component from `config/app.php` will not be reflected when testing email settings from Settings → Email.
:::

### Queue Component

Craft’s job queue is powered by the [Yii2 Queue Extension](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-queue). By default Craft will use a [custom queue driver](craft\queue\Queue) based on the extension’s [DB driver](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-queue/blob/master/docs/guide/driver-db.md), but you can switch to a different driver by overriding Craft’s `queue` component from `config/app.php`:

```php
<?php

return [
    'components' => [
        'queue' => [
            'class' => \yii\queue\redis\Queue::class,
            'redis' => 'redis', // Redis connection component or its config
            'channel' => 'queue', // Queue channel key
        ], 
    ],
    
    // ...
];
```

Available drivers are listed in the [Yii2 Queue Extension documentation](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-queue/tree/master/docs/guide).

::: warning
Only drivers that implement <api:craft\queue\QueueInterface> will be visible within the Control Panel.
:::

::: tip
If your queue driver supplies its own worker, set the <config:runQueueAutomatically> config setting to `false` in `config/general.php`.
