# About Craft CMS

Craft is a content-first CMS that aims to make life enjoyable for developers and content managers alike. It does so by offering developers a high level of flexibility, both in terms of content modeling and the front-end views, while also giving content managers an intuitive authoring experience.

## What it’s For

We made Craft for bespoke websites and mobile applications, where strong control over branding and content types are a priority. We optimized it for creating experiences from scratch, rather than modifying existing themes.

## General Tech Specs

Craft is a self-hosted PHP application built on [Yii](https://www.yiiframework.com/). You don’t need to know PHP or Yii to use it unless you intend to write your own plugins.
